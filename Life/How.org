* Life
** Meaning
*** I am the kind of person, who can't stick with anything for long
*** Meaning is kind of like a commitment
*** So, My life has no meaning
** Why
*** Why live this life?
*** Well, I don't know
*** But I've been gifted with life whether I want it or not
*** So, before I die, I'm going to see, taste, experience, solve everything I can.
*** A better question would be, 'How?'
** How
*** The best life lived is the one where you feel most alive
*** Figure out what makes you feel alive
*** There are Chores in life you have to get through though
*** Figure out how to deal with chores
